# Coding-for-Artists-Creative-Programming-Course-with-LlaMa
This project, as the first course that facilitates creative programming for artists, utilizes and promotes the use of LlaMa in artistic creation. We target the general public with artistic or non-professional programming backgrounds, building an online community that boosts the collaboration between art and technology.
